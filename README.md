# Latina Divas :dancer:
UT Austin Coding Bootcamp | Unit 19 react \
v1.0 \
Orig. Deployment - January 8, 2019

# Challenge
Build our first app using React.js! Additionally, build logic for a memory game. I have been obsessed with 80's music lately, and specifically, by Latina women. Enjoy!

Here's how it works:

- Clone the repo to your local server
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
- Each image listens for click events. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered will shuffle themselves in a random order. Remember, don't click on the same image twice!
- Have fun!

The game uses basic concepts in express, handlebars and MVC. A very fun way to start playing with the MVC concept especially!
